This is a demo of a simple web chat app using golang and websockets.

This requires the go websocket package, to get the package

<code>go get golang.org/x/net/websocket</code>

To get the files for this example app

<code>go get github.com/freeddser/simpleChat

<code>go install</code>

If your not going to need to call it from anywhere but the current folder then dont do anything.
